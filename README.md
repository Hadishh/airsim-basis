# Description
This project is an implementation of autonomous driving program with [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim). I used Deep RL network. Inception_v3 used for encoding images. You need to observe and then train the network. To do so, you probably need latest version of Unreal Engine. More details are available in Airsim page.
